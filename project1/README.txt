I feel that I have met the requirements of the projects with the programs included in my submission. I have gotten well-acquainted with child processes and feel quite confident in my ability to use them in the future.

The project, itself, does not stray from the example outlined in the assignment instructions. The only differences may be minor changes in the language used in printf() statements.

One thing the teaching staff should know is that slugrace.c does have some variability in execution time depending on how exhausted your CPU is with other processes. I found that, on some occasions, a slug that was meant to run for 3 seconds would run for 4 seconds. It was only slightly inconsistent on my machine though, and most of the time the slugs would run for the correct amount of time.

To keep track of background jobs, I took a very slow step-by-step procedure in writing each of the programs. I took time to write them in such an order where I focused on small bits at a time that build upon what was already written, expanding the complexity and maintaining funcionality at the same time. If something became buggy or inconsistent (besides issues with timing, as explained above), I took the time to discover why and make changes to the program.

Finally, I made the decision to test my programs through the use of a debugger and occasional printf() statements. Each has a place and I used them to fit my needs when necessary. One particular scanario where debugging came in handy was when the file name for seed_slug_X.txt needed to be parsed with a desired value. It took me a while to get everything working, as I continued to have difficulties with types not matching and, in earlier versions, pointers not functioning as I intended them to (though, I now feel a lot more comfortable with pointers as a result).

Overall, I thought this project was fun!
